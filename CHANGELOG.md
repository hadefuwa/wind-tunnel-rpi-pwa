# Wind Tunnel PWA - Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v1.2.0] - 2025-01-08

### ‚ú® New Features
- **Interactive STL Positioning System**: Complete drag-and-drop positioning for STL car models
- **Edit Position Button**: Added dedicated button on main screen for entering edit mode
- **Visual Direction Indicators**: Blue arrows show allowed movement directions during edit mode
- **Grid Snapping**: Car positions snap to 0.5 unit grid for precise placement
- **View-Specific Movement**: Simplified single-axis movement per camera view
  - Front view: Left-right movement only
  - Side view: Up-down movement only  
  - Top view: Left-right movement only

### üîß Improvements
- **Floor Constraint Protection**: Cars can no longer go below the floor surface
- **Improved STL Ground Positioning**: STL models now sit perfectly flat on the ground
- **Enhanced Test Section**: Clean 12√ó6√ó4 dimensions with solid gray floor
- **Better Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators during edit mode with proper color coding
- **Optimized Performance**: Improved memory management and resource cleanup

### üé® Visual Updates
- **Blue Direction Arrows**: Changed from green to blue to avoid conflict with wind indicators
- **Solid Floor**: Replaced transparent walls with solid gray floor for better reference
- **Removed Confusing Elements**: Eliminated yellow wireframe box and green alignment lines

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed car positioning going under the floor
- Resolved STL model floating above ground surface
- Fixed direction arrow visibility conflicts
- Improved bounds checking for car movement
- Enhanced position saving and loading

### üîÑ Technical Changes
- Enhanced `CarModel.setPosition()` with floor constraint enforcement
- Updated `WindTunnel.getTestSectionBounds()` with proper Y-axis limits
- Improved drag system with better raycasting and mouse handling
- Added comprehensive position validation throughout the system
